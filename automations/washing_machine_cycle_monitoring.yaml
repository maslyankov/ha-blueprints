  name: "[Blueprint] Dryer / Washing Machine Cycle Monitoring"
  description: >
    This blueprint monitors a washing machine's power and energy usage, updates the status of the washing machine, and sends a notification when the washing cycle finishes.
    

    Before using this blueprint, ensure you have set up two 'input_number' helpers, one 'notify' group, and one 'input_boolean' helper in your Home Assistant configuration. 


    1. Washing Start Energy Helper: An 'input_number' helper to store the energy reading at the start of the washing cycle.
    
    2. Last Washing Energy Used Helper: Another 'input_number' helper to store the energy used in the last washing cycle.
    
    3. Notification Group: A 'notify' group in the helper section to specify where the notifications should be sent.
    
    4. Washing Machine Status: An 'input_boolean' helper to represent the status of the washing machine.


    Once you have created these helpers, input the following into the blueprint:

    1. Device friendly name: The friendly name of the device to be used in the notifications of the automation.

    2. Washing Machine Power Sensor: The power sensor entity of your washing machine.
    
    3. Washing Machine Energy Sensor: The energy sensor entity of your washing machine.
    
    4. Start Power Threshold: The power threshold (in Watts) indicating the start of the washing cycle. Default is 100W.
    
    5. End Power Threshold: The power threshold (in Watts) indicating the end of the washing cycle. Default is 10W.
    
    6. Notification Group: The 'notify' group you created for sending notifications.
    
    7. Washing Start Energy Helper: Select the 'input_number' helper you created to store the energy at the start of the washing cycle.
    
    8. Last Washing Energy Used Helper: Select the 'input_number' helper you created to store the energy used in the last washing cycle.
    
    9. Washing Machine Status: Select the 'input_boolean' helper you created to represent the status of the washing machine.


    The automation will monitor the washing machine's power, update the 'input_number' helpers, and the status of the washing machine accordingly. At the end of each washing cycle, it will send a notification with the energy used in the last cycle.
