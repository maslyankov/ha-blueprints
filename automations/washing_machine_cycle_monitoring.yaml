  name: "[Blueprint] Washing Machine Cycle Monitoring"
  description: >
    This blueprint monitors a washing machine's power and energy usage and sends a notification when the washing cycle finishes.
    
    Before using this blueprint, make sure you have set up two 'input_number' helpers and one 'notify' group in your Home Assistant configuration. 

    1. Washing Start Energy Helper: An 'input_number' helper to store the energy reading at the start of the washing cycle.
    2. Last Washing Energy Used Helper: Another 'input_number' helper to store the energy used in the last washing cycle.
    3. Notification Group: A 'notify' group in the helper section to specify where the notifications should be sent.

    Once you have created these helpers, input the following into the blueprint:

    1. Washing Machine Power Sensor: The power sensor entity of your washing machine.
    2. Washing Machine Energy Sensor: The energy sensor entity of your washing machine.
    3. Start Power Threshold: The power threshold (in Watts) indicating the start of the washing cycle. Default is 100W.
    4. End Power Threshold: The power threshold (in Watts) indicating the end of the washing cycle. Default is 10W.
    5. Notification Group: The 'notify' group you created for sending notifications.
    6. Washing Start Energy Helper: Select the 'input_number' helper you created to store the energy at the start of the washing cycle.
    7. Last Washing Energy Used Helper: Select the 'input_number' helper you created to store the energy used in the last washing cycle.

    The automation will monitor the washing machine's power and update the 'input_number' helpers accordingly. At the end of each washing cycle, it will send a notification with the energy used in the last cycle.
